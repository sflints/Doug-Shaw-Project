<h2 id="david">David Hasselhoff</h2>
  <p  style="font-family: cambria, serif">David Michael Hasselhoff (born July 17, 1952),[1] nicknamed "The Hoff",[2] is an American actor, singer, producer, and businessman, who set a Guinness World Record as the most watched man on TV.[3] He first gained recognition on The Young and The Restless, playing Dr. Snapper Foster. His career continued with his leading role as Michael Knight on Knight Rider and as L.A. County Lifeguard Mitch Buchannon in the series Baywatch. Hasselhoff produced Baywatch from the 1990s until 2001 when the series ended with Baywatch Hawaii. On screen, he appeared in films including Click, Dodgeball, The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie, and Hop.
In 2000, he made his Broadway debut in the musical Jekyll and Hyde. Following his debut, he starred in other musicals including Chicago and The Producers.</p>
  <p style="font-family: cambria, serif">Hasselhoff was recruited by then NBC President Brandon Tartikoff to star in the science-fiction series Knight Rider from 1982 to 1986 as Michael Knight. He has described Knight Rider as more than a TV show: "It's a phenomenon. It's bigger than Baywatch ever was." On the success of Knight Rider – "It's because it was about saving lives, not taking lives, and it was how one man really can make a difference. And we had a blast making it, and we made sure nobody died on the show; [just as] we made sure nobody ever drowned on Baywatch". (However, characters did die in a few episodes, including "Knight Of The Phoenix" (the two-hour pilot episode), "Nobody Does It Better" and "Short Notice".)
He describes the acting he has done as "a little more difficult than if you had a regularly well-written script – like, if I was going to be in, say, Reservoir Dogs, or The Godfather, or Dances with Wolves or Lawrence of Arabia or ER, I had to talk to a car."[10] His role in the show led him to a People's Choice Award for 'Most Popular Actor'.[11] Now, over 33 years later, the show is still playing throughout the world.[12]</p>

<h2 id="pat">Patricia McPherson</h2>
  <p style="font-family: cambria, serif">Patricia McPherson (born November 27, 1954, Oak Harbor, Washington) is an American actress. She is known for her role in the 1980s TV series Knight Rider as Bonnie Barstow, KITT's mechanic. She appeared in season one and was absent from season two, but she was subsequently asked to return to the show, which she did in the season-three opener, remaining from 1984 until the end of the series in 1986.
The daughter of a naval officer, McPherson graduated from San Diego State University with a degree in advertising.
McPherson has made guest appearances in a variety of television shows including Dynasty, Starman, Murder She Wrote, MacGyver, Matlock, and Star Trek: The Next Generation.
McPherson is very active conserving wildlife and the forests; her efforts have included helping in attempts to preserve the Ballona Wetlands in southern California and working with the Ballona Wetlands Trust to sue the Playa Vista community for failure to take action concerning methane.
She retired from acting in 1991, although she made a cameo appearance as a Regent in the Syfy television series Warehouse 13 in 2009.</strong></p>

<h2 id="kitt">K.I.T.T</h2>
  <p style="font-family: cambria, serif">KITT is the short name of two fictional characters from the adventure TV series Knight Rider. While having the same acronym, the KITTs are two different entities: one known as the Knight Industries Two Thousand, which appeared in the original TV series Knight Rider, and the other as the Knight Industries Three Thousand, which appeared first in the two-hour 2008 pilot film for a new Knight Rider TV series and then the new series itself. In both instances, KITT is an artificially intelligent electronic computer module in the body of a highly advanced, very mobile, robotic automobile: the original KITT as a 1982 Pontiac Trans Am, and the second KITT as a 2008/2009 Ford Shelby GT500KR. KITT was voiced by William Daniels in the original series, and by Val Kilmer in the 2008 series.</p>
